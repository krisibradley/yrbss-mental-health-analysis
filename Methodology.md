# üî¨ Methodology: YRBSS Mental Health Analysis

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive methodology for analyzing the 2023 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) data to predict persistent sadness and hopelessness among high school students.

## üìä Data Source & Collection

### Survey Design
- **Survey Name:** Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) 2023
- **Administered by:** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
- **Survey Period:** Spring 2023 (typically March-May)
- **Target Population:** Students in grades 9-12 in public and private schools

### Sampling Methodology
- **Design:** Three-stage cluster sampling design
- **Stage 1:** Primary sampling units (counties/groups of counties)
- **Stage 2:** Schools within selected areas
- **Stage 3:** Classes within selected schools
- **Weighting:** Applied to adjust for nonresponse and oversampling

### Sample Characteristics

- **Valid Q26 Responses:** 19,863 students (98.8% response rate)
- **Geographic Coverage:** Nationally representative
- **School Types:** Public and private schools included

## üéØ Research Question & Objectives

### Primary Research Question
What factors predict persistent sadness and hopelessness among U.S. high school students?

### Specific Objectives
1. **Identify** the prevalence of persistent sadness/hopelessness (Q26)
2. **Determine** the strongest predictors from 100+ behavioral variables
3. **Develop** machine learning models for early identification
4. **Analyze** risk and protective factors separately
5. **Evaluate** demographic variations in mental health outcomes
6. **Create** actionable insights for intervention programs

## üîç Variable Selection & Data Processing

### Target Variable
- **Q26:** "During the past 12 months, did you ever feel so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more in a row that you stopped doing some usual activities?"
- **Coding:** 1 = Yes, 2 = No
- **Recoding for Analysis:** 1 = Yes (persistent sadness), 0 = No (resilient)
- **Clinical Significance:** Aligns with DSM-5 criteria for major depressive episodes

### Predictor Variables

#### Inclusion Criteria
- **Original survey questions only** (Q1-Q107, demographic variables)
- **Exclude derived variables** (QN*, qn* prefixes) to prevent correlation inflation
- **Exclude structural variables** (stratum, psu, weight) used for survey design
- **Minimum sample size:** 500+ valid responses per variable

#### Variable Categories Analyzed
1. **Demographics:** Age, sex, grade, race/ethnicity (5 variables)
2. **Mental Health:** Suicide ideation, attempts, plans (4 variables)
3. **Substance Use:** Alcohol, tobacco, drugs, prescription misuse (15 variables)
4. **Violence & Safety:** Fighting, bullying, dating violence (10 variables)
5. **Sexual Behavior:** Activity, contraception, contacts (8 variables)
6. **Physical Health:** Weight, exercise, sleep, nutrition (12 variables)
7. **Social Environment:** School, family, community factors (8 variables)
8. **Risk Behaviors:** Driving, weapon carrying, risky activities (6 variables)

#### Data Quality Filters
- **Missing Data Threshold:** Variables with >50% missing excluded
- **Correlation Threshold:** |r| > 0.05 for meaningful relationships
- **Sample Size Requirement:** Minimum 500 valid pairs for correlation calculation

## üßÆ Statistical Analysis Methods

### Descriptive Statistics
- **Frequency distributions** for all categorical variables
- **Cross-tabulations** between Q26 and key predictors
- **Prevalence calculations** with 95% confidence intervals
- **Demographic breakdowns** by subgroups

### Correlation Analysis
- **Method:** Pearson product-moment correlation
- **Interpretation:** 
  - |r| > 0.5: Very strong relationship
  - |r| 0.3-0.5: Strong relationship
  - |r| 0.2-0.3: Moderate relationship
  - |r| 0.1-0.2: Weak relationship
  - |r| < 0.1: Very weak/no relationship

### Variable Naming Convention
- **Original codes** (Q84) mapped to **meaningful names** (Current_mental_health)
- **Systematic naming** for interpretability
- **Consistent formatting** across all analyses

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Pipeline

### Data Preprocessing

#### Missing Data Handling
```python
# Strategy: Median imputation for numeric variables
for col in X.columns:
    if X[col].isnull().any():
        X[col].fillna(X[col].median(), inplace=True)
```

#### Feature Selection
- **Top 15 predictors** based on correlation strength
- **Gender (Q2)** included due to known mental health differences
- **Domain knowledge** applied to ensure relevant variables

#### Class Imbalance Handling
- **Problem:** 40.8% positive class (persistent sadness) vs 59.2% negative class
- **Solution:** SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
- **Rationale:** Prevents model bias toward majority class

### Model Selection & Training

#### Algorithms Evaluated
1. **Logistic Regression**
   - Baseline linear model
   - Interpretable coefficients
   - Handles binary classification naturally

2. **Random Forest**
   - Ensemble method with feature importance
   - Handles non-linear relationships
   - Robust to outliers

3. **Gradient Boosting**
   - Sequential learning algorithm
   - High predictive accuracy
   - Handles complex interactions

#### Model Configuration
```python
models = {
    'Logistic Regression': LogisticRegression(random_state=42, max_iter=1000),
    'Random Forest': RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42, n_jobs=1),
    'Gradient Boosting': GradientBoostingClassifier(random_state=42)
}
```

### Validation Strategy

#### Train/Test Split
- **Split ratio:** 80% training, 20% testing
- **Stratification:** Maintains class distribution in both sets
- **Random state:** Fixed for reproducibility

#### Cross-Validation
- **Method:** 5-fold stratified cross-validation
- **Metric:** AUC-ROC (Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic)
- **Rationale:** AUC is robust to class imbalance

#### Performance Metrics
- **Primary:** AUC-ROC (discrimination ability)
- **Secondary:** Precision, recall, F1-score
- **Interpretation:** AUC > 0.8 considered excellent

## üìä Statistical Interpretation

### Correlation Interpretation
- **Positive correlation with Q26:** Protective factor (higher values = less sadness)
- **Negative correlation with Q26:** Risk factor (higher values = more sadness)
- **Note:** Q26 coded as 1=Yes(sad), 2=No(not sad), so interpretation is reversed

### Feature Importance
- **Random Forest:** Gini importance scores
- **Interpretation:** Higher values = more predictive power
- **Ranking:** Top 15 features displayed with names

### Model Comparison
- **ROC Curves:** Visual comparison of model performance
- **AUC Values:** Quantitative discrimination ability
